In this assignment you will be developing a simple game in java. All development (coding, compilation, execution) will (`host take place remotelly on your Linux workstation (the one you set up in the [linux-server-assignment](https://github.com/mariopineda/linux-server-assignment)) using the Raspberry Pi as a remote terminal.

After obtaining the ip address of your Linux server (`hostname -I`) you can connect to it from your Raspberry Pi using ssh (`ssh -X <ip address>`). For this assignment you have the option of choosing the code editor of your choice. A few good choices are:
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/): concole-based editor that is ubiquitous and exceptionally powerful
- [atom](https://atom.io/) or [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): both state-of-the-art GUI code editors

Make sure your Linux server has the following software installed:
- the code editor of your choices
- git
- JDK

Depending on your Linux distribution the installation method will vary.
