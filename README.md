# netbeans-1
In this assignment you will be developing a simple game in java. All development (coding, compilation, execution) will (`host take place remotelly on your Linux workstation (the one you set up in the [linux-server-assignment](https://github.com/mariopineda/linux-server-assignment)) using the Raspberry Pi as a remote terminal.

# Tools and Set Up
After obtaining the ip address of your Linux server (`hostname -I`) you can connect to it from your Raspberry Pi using ssh (`ssh -X <ip address>`). For this assignment you have the option of choosing the code editor of your choice. A few good choices are:
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/): concole-based editor that is ubiquitous and exceptionally powerful
- [atom](https://atom.io/) or [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): both state-of-the-art GUI code editors

Make sure your Linux server has the following software installed:
- the code editor of your choices
- git
- JDK
Depending on your Linux distribution the installation method will vary.

# Java game
In this assignment you will be developing a simple java-based game by following along a video tutorial of your choice. You will choose of of the following tutorials:
- [Top Down Shooter game](https://youtu.be/e9jRfgjV4FQ), 14 parts
- [Wave game](https://youtu.be/2HaTSSE4skU), 15 parts
- [Platform game](https://youtu.be/DXT11ZbB2Mk), 17 parts

# Marking
- Up to 75%: Finishing one of the tutorial with a java game having the same functionality as in the tutorial (no modifications or extra features added).
- Above 75%: Original game has been extensivelly modified and extended with additional functionality.
